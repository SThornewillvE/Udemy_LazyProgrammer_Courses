# Udemy Lazy Programmer Courses

## Description

During my time working as a Junior Data Analyst, I was given access to Udemy for Business and I decided that I might learn a thing or do by working through the courses from Lazy Programmer.

What I like about this instructor is that he has a strong emphasis on both practical experience and theory.

For each section, there are usually a number of sections where we implement machine learning algorithms. My aim is to try and implement these algorithms without making large use of ML APIs and the solutions given by the instructor.

I wish to upload my progress so that I can reference it in the future.

## Important files and Notes

Each folder belongs to a course that can be found on his webpage [deeplearningcourses.com](https://deeplearningcourses.com).

Files are written in Python.
